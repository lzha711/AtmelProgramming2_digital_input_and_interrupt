# AtmelProgramming_digital_input_and_interrupt
Digital input practice and interrupt, including external interrupt and pin change interrupt

A small and learning project on reading digital input and turn on LED when push button is pressed. 
The main loop has one LED toggling state the whole time. 
So reading push button state and take action is done through interrupts. 
One external interrupt (INT0/PD2) and one pin change interrupt (PCINT16/PD0) are configured for two LEDs
Code and circuit diagram is included.
